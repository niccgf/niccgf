- 👋  Hi, I’m Nic =)
- 👀  I'm a Software Developer Analyst @ Mercado Libre, latin america biggest e-commerce platform with over 76M users all over the region
- 📈  As a Customer Experience Semi Senior Representative, I leaded projects focused in improving the team's metrics and performance, detecting early-stage inconveniences with new processes, while simultaneously polishing improvement opportunities in certain & strategical business units. Also, I was in charge of new incorporations' capacitation stage, sharing knowledge about certain processes, following a stated guideline and meeting rigurous requirements
- 🎓  I'm a permanent learner. I developed soft skills such as *effective presentations*, *andragogy*, *problem solving*, and *communicational skills overall*; but also some hard skills too, like *data analytics*
- 🌱  As I stated before, I'm always learning! Right now I'm focussing on my delevoping skills, pracitising automation and depuration notebooks with Python, and front end development overall (HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript)
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on any project in which I add value, and in reversal, any project from which I can learn something new :D
- 📫  You can reach me writing to nicolasgonzalofalcon@gmail.com, or you can find me in Telegram: **@niccgf**
